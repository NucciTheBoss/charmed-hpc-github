# `labels` Terraform plan

This is a Terraform plan for managing labels in the Charmed HPC GitHub organization using the
GitHub Terraform provider. For more information, refer to the
[documentation](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/integrations/github/latest/docs)
for the GitHub Terraform provider.

## Requirements

This plan requires that you have a GitHub Personal Access Token (PAT) that grants organization-wide
permissions to edit issue and pull request labels. Refer to the [usage](#usage) section for more details.

## Managed organization repositories

Below is the list of Charmed HPC organization repositories whose labels are managed by the
`labels` Terraform plan:

* .github
* apptainer-operator
* charmed-hpc-benchmarks
* charmed-hpc-terraform
* docs
* hpc-libs
* slurm-charms
* slurm-snap
* slurmutils
* filesystem-charms
* ondemand-snap

To add a new repository to the `labels` plan, add the repository's name
to the default set declared by the `repository` variable in [_variables.tf_](./variables.tf). Note
that the `labels` plan will fail with the 422 HTTP error code if the newly added repository already
has a label with the same name as a label defined in the plan.

## Usage

To add the labels to the organization repositories, first generate a Personal Access Token (PAT) with permission
to edit Issue/Pull Request labels. You can generate a PAT by navigating in GitHub to Settings > Developer
settings > Personal access tokens > Fine-grained tokens and then select ___Generate new token___.

From the ___Generate new token___ page, provide a token name and then set the `charmed-hpc` GitHub organization
as the resource owner:

![Resource owner dropdown on Generate new token page with the `charmed-hpc` GitHub organization set as the owner](../../.github/images/resource-owner.png)

After setting `charmed-hpc` as the resource owner, now set the repository access
to all repositories:

!["All repositories" radio button selected for repository access permission level](../../.github/images/repository-access-all-repositories.png)

Now set the repository permissions for _Issues_ to __Read and write__:

![Repository permissions for Issues with Access dropdown set to "Read and write"](../../.github/images/repository-permissions-issues-read-and-write.png)

With all the PAT options set, generate the token and copy it to your clipboard.

Now, run the `just apply` recipe with the following command, passing your
newly generated PAT as an environment variable:

```shell
CHARMED_HPC_ORG_PAT=<your PAT token> just apply labels
```

After a few minutes, Terraform should complete updating the all the given repository labels.
